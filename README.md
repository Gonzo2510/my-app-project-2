# Contact Book

This is a single page online contact book. The application has a navigation bar that allows the user to switch between pages. It consists of a Home page, Contacts page, and an Add Contact page. The Home page has a welcome message. The Contacts page displays all of the contacts hosted in the db.json server file. The user is able to delete any contact of their choice by clicking on the delete button next the contact they wish to delete. Lastly the Add Contact page allows the user to add a contact. The form will clear when the user submits the contact to the server and the new contact will appear on the contacts page at the bottom of the list.
