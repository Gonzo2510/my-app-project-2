This is a very simple online contact book. There is a navigation bar to route between the different pages. Starting off is the home page with a welcome message. Next is the contacts page with the different contacts retrieved from the online database file. Attached to each contact is a delete button which will remove it from the online database and the page. Lastly, is the add contact page where you can add a contact if you so choose.
